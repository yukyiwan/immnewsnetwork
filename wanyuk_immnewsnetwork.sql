(1, 2, 'Webwaste', 'Gerry McGovern', '2020-07-09', 'The Web is obese\r\nIn 1994, there were 3,000 websites. In 2019, there were estimated to be 1.7 billion, almost one website for every three people on the planet. Not only has the number of websites exploded, the weight of each page has also skyrocketed. Between 2003 and 2019, the average webpage weight grew from about 100 KB to about 4 MB. The results?', '“In our analysis of 5.2 million pages,” Brian Dean reported for Backlinko in October 2019, “the average time it takes to fully load a webpage is 10.3 seconds on desktop and 27.3 seconds on mobile.” In 2013, Radware calculated that the average load time for a webpage on mobile was 4.3 seconds.\r\n\r\nStudy after study shows that people absolutely hate slow webpages. In 2018, Google research found that 53% of mobile site visitors left a page that took longer than three seconds to load. A 2015 study by Radware found that “a site that loads in 3 seconds experiences 22% fewer page views, a 50% higher bounce rate, and a 22% fewer conversions than a site that loads in 1 second, while a site that loads in 5 seconds experiences 35% fewer page views, a 105% higher bounce rate, and 38% fewer conversions.”\r\n\r\nThe causes of webpage bloat? Images and videos are mainly to blame. By 2022, it’s estimated that online videos will make up more than 82% of all consumer Internet traffic—15 times more than in 2017. However, from the code to the content, everything about Web design has become super-bloated and super-polluting. Consider that if a typical webpage that weighs 4 MB is downloaded 600,000 times, one tree will need to be planted in order to deal with the resulting pollution.\r\n\r\nThey say a picture paints a thousand words. Well, 1,000 words of text takes up roughly two A4 (210 mm wide and 297 mm long) pages and weighs about 6 KB. You’d place about four images that are 9 cm x 16 cm on two A4 pages. Let’s say these images are well optimized and weigh 40 KB each. (A poorly optimized image could weigh several megabytes.) Even with such high optimization, two A4 pages of images will weigh around 160 KB. That’s 27 times more than the two A4 pages of text. A 30-second video, on the other hand, could easily weigh 3 MB. Videos create massively more pollution than text. Text is the ultimate compression technique. It is by far the most environmentally friendly way to communicate. If you want to save the planet, use more text. Think about digital weight.\r\n\r\nFrom an energy point of view, it’s not simply about page weight. Some pages may have very heavy processing demands once they are downloaded. Other pages, particularly those that are ad-driven, will download with lots of third-party websites hanging off them, either feeding them content, or else demanding to be fed data, often personal data on the site’s visitor. It’s like a type of Trojan Horse. You think you’re accessing one website or app, but then all these other third parties start accessing you. According to Trent Walton, the top 50 most visited websites had an average of 22 third-party websites hanging off them. The New York Times had 64, while Washington Post had 63. All these third-party websites create pollution and invade privacy.\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous amount of out-of-date content on websites. I have worked with hundreds of websites where we had to delete up to 90% of the pages in order to start seeing improvements. Poorly written, out-of-date code is also a major problem. By cleaning up its JavaScript code, Wikipedia estimated that they saved 4.3 terabytes a day of data bandwidth for their visitors. By saving those terabytes, we saved having to plant almost 700 trees to deal with the yearly pollution that would have been caused.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help save the planet, reduce digital weight. Clean up your website. Before you add an image, make sure that it does something useful and it’s the most optimized image possible. Every time you add code, make sure it does something useful and it’s the leanest code possible. Always be on the lookout for waste images, waste code, waste content. Get into the habit of removing something every time you add something.\r\n\r\nPublishing is an addiction. Giving a website to an organization is like giving a pub to an alcoholic. You remember the saying, “There’s a book inside everyone”? Well, the Web let the book out. It’s happy days for a while as we all publish, publish, publish. Then…\r\n\r\n“Hi, I’m Gerry. I have a 5,000-page website.”\r\n\r\n“Hi, Gerry.”\r\n\r\n“I used to have a 500-page website, but I had no self-control. It was one more page, one more page… What harm could one more page do?”\r\n\r\nRedesign is rehab for websites. Every two to three years some manager either gets bored with the design or some other manager meets a customer who tells them about how horrible it is to find anything on the website. The design team rounds up a new bunch of fake images and fake content for the top-level pages, while carefully avoiding going near the heaving mess at the lower levels. After the launch, everyone is happy for a while (except the customers, of course) because in many organizations what is important is to be seen to be doing things and producing and launching things, rather than to do something useful.\r\n\r\nIf you must do something, do something useful. That often means not doing, removing, minimizing, cleaning up.\r\n\r\nBeware the tiny tasks. We’ve used the Top Tasks method to identify what matters and what doesn’t matter to people, whether they’re buying a car, choosing a university, looking after their health, buying some sort of technology product, or whatever. In any environment we’ve carried it out in—and we’ve done it more than 500 times—there are no more than 100 things that could potentially matter.\r\n\r\nIn a health environment, these might include symptoms, treatment, prevention, costs, waiting times, etc. When buying a car they might include price, engine type, warranties, service costs, etc. We’ve carried out Top Tasks surveys in some 40 countries and 30 languages, with upwards of 400,000 people voting. In every single survey the same patterns emerge. Let’s say there are 100 potential tasks. People are asked to vote on the tasks that are most important to them. When the results come in, we will find that five of the tasks will get the first 25% of the vote. 50 tasks will get the final 25% of the vote. The top five tasks get as much of the vote as the bottom 50. It’s the same pattern in Norway, New Zealand, Israel, USA, Canada, UK, Brazil, wherever.\r\n\r\nThe bottom 50 are what I call the tiny tasks. When a tiny task goes to sleep at night it dreams of being a top task. These tiny tasks—the true waste generators—are highly ambitious and enthusiastic. They will do everything they can to draw attention to themselves, and one of the best ways of doing that is to produce lots of content, design, code.\r\n\r\nOnce we get the Top Tasks results, we sometimes analyze how much organizational effort is going into each task. Invariably, there is an inverse relationship between the importance of the task to the customer and the effort that the organization is making in relation to these tasks. The more important it is to the customer, the less is being done; the less important it is to the customer, the more is being done.\r\n\r\nBeware of focusing too much energy, time and resources on the tiny tasks. Reducing the tiny tasks is the number one way you can reduce the number of pages and features. Save the planet. Delete the tiny tasks.\r\n\r\nA plague of useless images\r\nI was giving a talk at an international government digital conference once, and I asked people to send me examples of where digital government was working well. One suggestion was for a website in a language I don’t speak. When I visited it, I saw one of those typical big images that you see on so many websites. I thought to myself: I’m going to try and understand this website based on its images.\r\n\r\nThe big image was of a well-dressed, middle-aged woman walking down the street while talking on her phone. I put on my Sherlock Holmes hat. Hmm… Something to do with telecommunications, perhaps? Why would they choose a woman instead of a man, or a group of women and men? She’s married, I deduced by looking at the ring on her finger. What is that telling me? And what about her age? Why isn’t she younger or older? And why is she alone? Questions, questions, but I’m no Sherlock Holmes. I couldn’t figure out anything useful from this image.\r\n\r\nI scrolled down the page. Ah, three more images. The first one is a cartoon-like image of a family on vacation. Hmm… The next one is of two men and one woman in a room. One of them has reached their hand out and placed it on something, but I can’t see what that something is, because the other two have placed their hands on top of that hand. It’s a type of pledge or something, a secret society, perhaps? Two of them are smiling and the third is trying to smile. What could that mean? And then the final picture is of a middle-aged man staring into the camera, neither smiling nor unsmiling, with a somewhat kind, thoughtful look. What is happening?\r\n\r\nI must admit that after examining all the visual evidence I had absolutely no clue what this government website was about. So, I translated it. It was about the employment conditions and legal status of government employees. Now, why didn’t I deduce that from the images?\r\n\r\nThe Web is smothering us in useless images that create lots of pollution. These clichéd, stock images communicate absolutely nothing of value, interest or use. They are one of the worst forms of digital pollution and waste, as they cause page bloat, making it slower for pages to download, while pumping out wholly unnecessary pollution. They take up space on the page, forcing more useful content out of sight, making people scroll for no good reason.\r\n\r\nInterpublic is a very large global advertising agency. As with all advertising agencies they stress how “creative” they are, which means they love huge, meaningless, happy-clappy polluting images. When I tested their homepage, it emitted almost 8 grams of CO2 as it downloaded, putting Interpublic in the worst 10% of website polluters, according to the Website Carbon Calculator. (For comparison, the Google homepage emits 0.23 grams.) One single image on its homepage weighed 3.2 MB. This image could easily have been 10 times smaller, while losing nothing in visual appeal. The Interpublic website is like a filthy, rusty 25-year-old diesel truck, belching fumes as it trundles down the Web.\r\n\r\nInstead of optimizing images so that they’ll download faster, the opposite is often happening. High-resolution images are a major cost to the environment. If, for example, you move from a 4K resolution image to an 8K one, the file size doesn’t double, it trebles. For example, I saved an image at 4K and it was 6.9 MB. At 8K it was 18 MB.\r\n\r\nDigital “progress” and “innovation” often means an increasing stress on the environment. Everything is more. Everything is higher. Everything is faster. And everything is exponentially more demanding of the environment. Digital is greedy for energy and the more it grows the greedier it gets. We need digital innovation that reduces environmental stress, that reduces the digital footprint. We need digital designers who think about the weight of every design decision they make.\r\n\r\nWe must start by trying to use the option that damages the environment least, and that is text. Don’t assume that images are automatically more powerful than text. Sometimes, text does the job better.\r\n\r\nIn a test with an insurance company, it was found that a promotion for a retirement product was deemed less accurate when an image of a face was used than when text only was used.\r\nAn initiative by the UK government to get people to sign up to become potential organ donors tested eight approaches. The approaches that used images were least effective. Text-only worked best.\r\n“Hello?”\r\n\r\n“Hello. Is that the Department of Useless Images?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“We have this contact form and we need a useless image for it.”\r\n\r\n“How about a family cavorting in a field of spring flowers with butterflies dancing in the background?”\r\n\r\n“Perfect.”\r\n\r\nThere are indeed many situations where images are genuinely useful, particularly when it comes to helping people better understand how a product works or looks. Airbnb, for example, found that its growth only began to accelerate after it invested in getting quality images of the rental properties on offer.\r\n\r\nIf you need to use images, optimize them and consider using real ones of real people doing real things.\r\n\r\nThey say a picture paints a thousand words but sometimes it’s a thousand words of crap.', 'https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/', 0, '1inn.png'),

So you’re interested in our subbrand Growth Quarters? Then join our online event, TNW2020, where you’ll hear how the most successful founders kickstarted and grew their companies.', 'Getting started into programming can be very scary, and there are a lot of misconceptions out there that make people think that programming is a skill they could never learn, or that landing a job as a web developer is almost mission impossible. They couldn’t be more wrong.\r\n\r\nThe software development industry, web development in particular, is full of amazing stories of people with no tech background who switched to development and changed their life for great and they couldn’t be happier with the change.\r\n\r\nProgramming is a great skill to have, it will teach you to think differently, it will open the doors to a lot of job opportunities even in these times where the job market is so hurt by the economic decline, and it will also give you an amazing talent to build your own projects and companies.\r\n\r\nI’m a self-taught developer, I tried college a few times a few years ago, to never succeed there, I was always getting bored in the classrooms and it just wasn’t for me. However thanks to the internet I was able to learn all my skills and become a great software engineer. As a side note here, today I’m completing my degree at an online university, not because I needed it to get a job in tech, or because it was limiting my career in any way, but because it’s a personal debt I want to pay off.\r\n\r\nGoing back to our topic here, let me present you my path to becoming a web developer, in particular, a front end developer (if you don’t know what this is, stay with me, I’ll explain it all), and my path to landing a first job in tech.\r\n\r\nSo, what is a web developer?\r\nCongrats! You decided to stay here, that means that you took the first step into becoming a web developer, but what exactly does it mean to be a web developer?\r\n\r\nI don’t want to be so obvious here, but a web developer is someone who utilizes a programming language to build web pages and applications. There are three types of web developers out there: front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers.\r\n\r\nFront-end developer\r\nA front-end developer is responsible for building what you see and interact with on a web page or application. It’s the specialist who transforms a design, an image, or an idea into the code that allows web browsers to display the website.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn’t underestimate the work front-end developers do, as web applications are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, the job of the front-end developer has been mutating from simply working on implementing the design to actually building full working applications which run within our browsers. This is for me a key role where you can combine tech, development, and design to build amazing experiences, and it’s my recommendation for those getting started. Starting in front-end would be an easier road than if you start in back-end.\r\n\r\nBack-end developer\r\nThis role is responsible for designing and building the systems that will support our front-end application. For example, when you click the “save” button, the back-end developer will write with code the algorithms and logic responsible for receiving your request, process it, store it in a database (if required) and send back the results so that the front-end can let you know it all went good.\r\n\r\nThe back-end is what makes applications work across multiple devices, or which makes it possible to store your information in the “could.”\r\n\r\nFull-stack developer\r\nThis is a new term for an old role, the full-stack developer is someone who can work both, front-end and back-end tasks.\r\n\r\nHow can you become a front-end developer?\r\nLet’s now jump into the steps that you need to become a front-end developer and land your first job.\r\n\r\nAll the steps I’m providing here and my recommendations are what I gather from years in the industry as a developer myself, working as a tech lead for a big multinational company where I interviewed many candidates and now in my role as a senior software engineer and content creator.\r\n\r\nLearn HTML & CSS\r\nIn order to become a front-end developer, the first thing you need to know is a little bit about how the web works. Have you ever wondered how your browser knows how to display items on the screen? How to position things and using which colors?\r\n\r\nHTML\r\nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language that is known by all web browsers and it’s used to describe the content of your site. Not so much the design of it, but the structure and content itself. HTML works with a specific syntax of tags and nodes and looks something like:\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe you don’t know what that code does yet, but I’m pretty sure you can at least identify some points, like there’s a title, and there’s some content like “Hello World!” there. HTML is made so it can be read by computers but also by humans in an almost natural way.\r\n\r\nThis is the place where you want to start, there are plenty of courses out there, pick one, and learn the concepts and how it works before moving on to CSS.\r\n\r\nHere are some free resources to get you started:\r\n\r\nLearn-HTML\r\nhtml.com\r\nHTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners (video)\r\nCSS\r\nNow that you know how to place content on the user’s screen we need to make it pretty and here is where CSS can help you. CSS is a code syntax designed to describe how HTML elements will be displayed on the screen. It allows developers to place the content in different positions on the screen, add colors, backgrounds, borders, fonts, animations, anything you need to match your design, is likely CSS supports it.\r\n\r\nLearning CSS is extremely important, no one would use nowadays a page with no design at all, this is a killer skill. Some people do really amazing things with CSS, from amazing designs to art, animations, it’s unbelievable.\r\n\r\nCSS looks something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit scarier, but perhaps you got an idea of what it could possibly do.\r\n\r\nHere are some free resources to get you started:\r\n\r\nLearn CSS by Mozilla\r\nCSS Beginner Guide on HTMLDog\r\nPractice\r\nBefore jumping into the next step, make sure you practice a lot. You can now build static websites, make many of them, start with the basics, move into more advanced features as you get used to it. Build a personal website, one for your dog or cat, add colors, backgrounds, images, titles, menus, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce you’re a little more comfortable with HTML and CSS, and this is important to avoid frustrations later on, move on to JavaScript.\r\n\r\nLearn JavaScript and change the world\r\nSo far you have been building amazing web pages, but they couldn’t do much right? You were able to present content, style it, and build great designs and animations but they were lacking interactive elements, dynamic parts, and this is what JavaScript is for.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is a programming language, in fact, it’s one of the most popular programming languages today available, which has the particularity of running in web browsers, and thus it can be used for building web applications.\r\n\r\nJavaScript allows you to interact with your HTML by handling events such as the user clicking on an element, timed events, and much more. It also allows you to dynamically change the contents of your page, meaning it has access to the “HTML,” or actually to the DOM of the page.\r\n\r\nJavaScript today migrated from the browser to many other applications. Many companies are building back-ends that run on JavaScript, even desktop applications are now built with it.\r\n\r\nLearning JavaScript will be a gigantic step towards achieving your goal of becoming a web developer, it will likely be the hardest, so take your time with this one, it won’t be easy, but it’s not impossible, and with the huge amount of free content out there, there are no excuses.\r\n\r\nSo do your reading and practice, practice, practice.\r\n\r\nHere are some resources to get you started:\r\n\r\nLearn JS\r\nFreeCodeCamp\r\nMake a portfolio site\r\nNow you have the skills it’s time to show them off. It’s very popular among developers to showcase your skills using a portfolio website. A portfolio website is basically a collection of your best projects to showcase to employers or future customers.\r\n\r\nUsually, developers would have two different portfolio websites:\r\n\r\nPersonal website\r\nBuild your own website and host it to show the world your talent. This website will be an upsell of your self, it’s the ultimate curriculum for developers, so make it to impress. One of the features on this website is a section where you will link or showcase your projects.\r\n\r\nOften you won’t only show the results, so a link to your project running on the internet, but also the source code for it. And here is where the next option is really good.\r\n\r\nGitHub\r\n\r\nGitHub is a website that allows you to host the code for your projects for free and open for everyone to see. GitHub is the most important open-source repository, and the home of many, many of the open applications out there. Getting an account is free, and you can start hosting your code within minutes. Learn all about it on their site .\r\n\r\nNow, you can use GitHub without any special tool by simply drag and drop files, however, what makes GitHub so special is that they run something called a GIT service, GIT is a technology for hosting code that makes team collaboration possible, and that allows you to look at your code at any point of time and see all the changes from there. It’s an amazing tool and it will be required for you to learn.\r\n\r\nThere are many resources for learning GIT:\r\n\r\nGit for Absolute Beginners\r\nGit Concepts and workflow for Beginners\r\nBuild a killer resume and start connecting\r\n\r\nNow that your portfolio is up, you need to work on your resume, and the right place to do this is on LinkedIn. You probably already know LinkedIn, but if not, check it out. You will need a LinkedIn account to get started building your resume, listing your projects, having a killer profile description, and more importantly, to start networking,\r\n\r\nAdd people from the field, many are willing to help, or they post daily with advice for people who are starting.\r\n\r\nLearn a Framework\r\nIt’s time now to step up your game and enter the world of frameworks. A framework is a set of functions and libraries that simplify the development tasks. Newer frameworks are sophisticated pieces of code that sometimes reinvent the way we even program web applications.\r\n\r\nSome of these frameworks are like a programming language on its own as they provide very specific ways to get things done. It may take some time to get used to them, but once you do, your productivity will boost.\r\n\r\nOne important thing here, there are many, many frameworks out there and you don’t need to learn them all. Choose one and start there, make a good choice, take one of the most popular frameworks out there, and master it. Perhaps you don’t like it, that’s alright, pick another and switch, but don’t try to learn at the beginning of all of them.\r\n\r\nMy personal recommendation is to go with one of the following:\r\n\r\nReactJS (my personal favorite)\r\nAngular\r\nVueJS\r\nThere are no right or wrong options here, there’s a preference and perhaps conveniences depending on the type of project. But they are of the bests in 2020.\r\n\r\nInterview prep\r\nWay to go! You are now a web developer, though you still need to get a job at it. Interviewing as a web developer is its own unique experience compared to other professions. You will have to show your interviewers your experience, which at this point are the side projects you built along your learning journey. You will also have to show the interviewer that you know how to code and that you have a certain knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and perhaps even of a particular framework.\r\n\r\nDon’t be surprised if the interview contains a section where you actually have to code live a short piece of code, or if you are sent a home assignment that you need to work on and present your results at a later interview. These are all common practices when interviewing for a developer position.\r\n\r\nMake sure you practice your skills before and you will be good to go.\r\n\r\nThere are sites which specialize in preparing for interviews, check them out and give them a try. Keep in mind your level though, some of those sites can get really complicated really fast, adjust your challenges to your experience.\r\n\r\nFinal words\r\nThe world of tech is constantly changing, and as developers working at the edge of technology, we need to do as well. Keeping yourself informed of the latest frameworks, techniques, programming languages, etc is crucial to remain effective in the workplace.\r\n\r\nYou just started a life long journey, which provides amazing opportunities, enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis article was originally published on Live Code Stream by Juan Cruz Martinez (twitter: @bajcmartinez), founder and publisher of Live Code Stream, entrepreneur, developer, author, speaker, and doer of things.\r\n\r\nLive Code Stream is also available as a free weekly newsletter.

Microsoft Corp. is teaming with Adobe Inc. and C3.ai, the company of customer-software pioneer Tom Siebel, in another bid to better compete with Salesforce.com Inc., the market leader for such programs. \r\n', 'C3.ai will release a new customer-relations management software program that blends its artificial intelligence tools with Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 CRM software and Adobe’s marketing and customer-targeting cloud. The offering pulls in an array of data from a client’s internal systems and outside information, such as social media sentiment and regulatory filings, to predict, for example, future revenue, what new products are needed and which customers might be ready to take their business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, the world’s largest software maker, has been trying for more than 15 years to catch Salesforce, the top vendor in the $56 billon market for customer-relations management software, according to Gartner Inc. While Salesforce had 20% market share in 2019 compared with Dynamics 2.6%, the most popular choice in Gartner’s data was “other” with 68%. The fragmented market creates an opportunity for Microsoft, C3 and Adobe, according to executives of the companies. The shift to cloud computing and the demand for AI tools means there’s a desire for new products, especially those that can analyze formerly siloed sets of data. Of course Salesforce is trying to do similar things — it has AI tools called Einstein and spent $6.5 billion to buy MuleSoft to offer products that combine a customer’s in-house systems with data and apps on the public internet. \r\n\r\n“Salesforce has done a fantastic job, but they have 20% share and therein lies the story — we talk about this as if it’s all over, and the reality is it is a pretty competitive market,” Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in an interview. Called C3 AI CRM powered by Microsoft Dynamics 365, the software is available beginning Monday and will be jointly sold by the three companies.\r\n\r\nThe partnership brings together executives with a long history in this part of the industry. Siebel pioneered software that manages and tracks a company’s interactions with clients when he founded Siebel Systems in 1993. Nadella ran the Dynamics business for Microsoft more than a decade ago and has reinvigorated Microsoft’s focus on it since taking over the top job in 2014. Adobe, the leader in software such as Photoshop for creative artists, has been a close partner of Microsoft in various efforts on its cloud businesses. Siebel’s C3.ai was founded in 2009 and now has customers including Bank of America Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and the U.S Defense Department. \r\n\r\nSiebel said customers want products tailored to their specific industry and that use AI to do things like reduce customer churn — tracking which customers may leave so the company can prevent it. Manufacturing customers meanwhile want to forecast how many units they need to make. Everyone wants to project revenue and the technology available today is “highly inaccurate,” he said. “Virtually every one of these customers that are approaching us are existing Salesforce users,” he said. \r\n\r\nSalesforce didn’t return a request for comment. \r\n\r\nAttracting more customers will also be a boon to Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure service, which is trying to narrow the gap with market leader Amazon.com Inc., and to Adobe’s Experience Cloud. The new product will run on Azure but will be able to take in data stored in other clouds. \r\n\r\nIt’s a much bigger market than the traditional one for customer-relations software that Siebel started and Salesforce leads. “This is now blending what the sales person wanted and what the marketing person wanted and what the finance person wanted,” said Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen.\r\n\r\n— With assistance by Nico Grant', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/microsoft-teams-with-adobe-and-c3-ai-to-take-on-salesforce-on-its-home-turf?srnd=technology-vp', 0, '4inn.png'),

Here’s how to enable it right now. Prior to Zoom’s end-to-end encryption rollout, Zoom calls were encrypted, but only between each user and Zoom’s servers—meaning, if Zoom wanted to, it could peek into a Zoom call or let others do so. With the launch of end-to-end encryption for Zoom, even Zoom itself has no way to look in on a user’s Zoom call.', 'Now that end-to-end encryption is available on Zoom, all users should make sure it’s enabled. Why? As mentioned, E2EE ensures no one else but meeting participants can gain access to the call and see and hear what is discussed. And since the meetings are now end-to-end encrypted, not even Zoom can bypass this. Given the sensitive business nature of most Zoom calls, any person who uses Zoom should ensure E2EE is enabled right away.\r\n\r\nHere’s how:\r\n\r\nSign in to the Zoom web portal in your web browser here (encryption can’t be enabled through the Zoom app itself).\r\nUnder the “Personal” heading, click Settings.\r\nClick the Meeting tab.\r\nClick Security.\r\nToggle the switch next to “Allow use of end-to-end encryption” to On (blue).\r\nEnter your phone number in the pop-up that appears. Zoom requires this so they can text you a code that you enter here, which helps them know it’s really you turning on E2EE.\r\nAfter entering the text code, select “End-to-end encryption” under the default encryption type on the Security page you are already on and click Save.\r\nOnce this is completed, all your Zoom calls will be end-to-end encrypted, provided the host allows for encryption. Account and group hosts can learn how to enable end-to-end encryption for all their calls here.\r\n\r\nThere are a few caveats using end-to-end encryption on Zoom. First, after following the steps above, your Zoom client will need to be updated to Zoom 5.4 or later on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS (wherever you use Zoom). Also note that third-party Zoom clients cannot support E2EE at this time. And keep in mind E2EE is limited to Zoom calls with 200 or fewer participants—so if you’ve got more than that, E2EE won’t be enabled even if you’ve set it up.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can confirm whether a Zoom call is using E2EE by verifying a green shield logo with a padlock on it is in the upper left corner of your meeting screen. If you see this logo, your Zoom meeting is using end-to-end encryption.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\nMichael Grothaus is a novelist, journalist, and former screenwriter.

New data from ChartHop shows that the pay gap in the tech industry is narrowing for women, but not for people of color. (The data includes no IT organizations in enterprises, government, or education — just tech providers.)', 'Based on anonymized personnel data from its tech industry customers, ChartHop was able to look at salary data by gender, ethnicity, and role of more than 16,000 employees at companies using its business operations software. ChartHop can’t say how representative its data is of the tech industry as a whole (which includes tech providers as well as business, government, and education). But its findings align to other published data from Glassdoor and the US Census Bureau.\r\n\r\n[ Take part in the 2021 IT Salary Survey from Insider Pro and Computerworld! ]\r\nWomen make less than men, but the gap is smaller than in 2018\r\nThe ChartHop customer data shows women in tech make 17.5% less in wages than men: $100,895 on average versus $122,234. The percentage difference is slightly better than for all women in the US, who make 20% less than men, on average. And the situation for women in tech is much better than in 2018, when they made on average 23% less than men, according to ChartHop’s data: $92,087 in wages versus $119,655.\r\n\r\nThe differences in wages vary only slightly with a person’s seniority: ChartHop found that lower-tier female employees make about 17.3% less than their male counterparts. Female managers fare better, making 13.8% less then male managers. ChartHop did not calculate the difference for executives, but the overall average of 17.5% disparity in women’s wages means female executives make at least 18%  less then male execs.\r\n\r\nWomen account for about 29% of executives and 39% of managers, but 44% of all tech employees. Overall, women account for 50.2% of the US working-age population.\r\n\r\nFemale engineers do the best in the tech sector, making 6.4% less this year than male engineers: $122,180 versus $130,585 on average. Female salespeople fare much worse, making 18.3% less than male salespeople: $74,404 compared to $91,110, on average.\r\n\r\n[ Looking to upgrade your career in tech? This comprehensive online course teaches you how. ]\r\nPeople of color are doing worse, especially Black and Latinx employees\r\nBlack and Latinx (Hispanic) tech employees face a bigger wage gap than women do. The ChartHop data show that in 2020 Black tech employees on average make 30.3% less than White employees: $90,873 versus $130,418, on average. Blacks account for 8% of tech employees at ChartHop customers, nearly double their percentage in 2018.\r\n\r\nLatinx tech employees make 24.8% less than Whites: $98,041 versus $130,418 on average. Latinx people account for 8% of tech employees at ChartHop customers, nearly double their percentage in 2018.\r\n\r\nThe ChartHop data also shows that the wage gaps for Black, Latinx, and Indigenous tech employees actually rose in 2020 versus 2018 and 2019. That is, people of color in tech face a greater disparity in pay in 2020. But it coudn\'t easily quantify the average wage gap per person given differences in roles, diferences in seniority, and number of positions.\r\n\r\nAmong people of color, Asian tech employees fare best, earning 1.7% less than Whites: $128,226 versus $130,418 on average.\r\n\r\nThe ChartHop data on people of color in tech doesn’t show the average salaries by role or seniority, as it does for women,. That leaves it unknown how much of the ethnic wage gap, and its worsening in 2020, is due to differences in proportion by seniority or the types of jobs held.\r\n\r\nA separate report by Crunchbase also shows that Black- and Latinx-led tech startups struggle to get VC funding, even in diverse states like California.', 'https://www.computerworld.com/article/3586552/women-do-better-minorities-worse-when-it-comes-to-the-tech-wage-gap.html', 1, '6inn.png'),
(7, 2, 'The Internet Needs a New Architecture that Puts Users First', 'DANIEL BERNINGER and JEFF PULVER', '2020-09-30', 'Treating the internet like a public utility only bolsters the platform giants. A more secure model starts with control by the people.', 'QUARANTINE HAS CHANGED the way we connect, online and off. As we rely on the internet more and more for work, social connections, and basic needs, it is time to talk about the future of meaningful online experiences, and the need for a new internet architecture. We need a user-focused, localized internet. This competitive architecture would deliver an experience that values real-time connectivity over one-way advertising and puts control with the user, not with big tech platforms.\r\n\r\nThis paradigm would flip the model on its head, letting people start with complete privacy and security, and from there allow them to open their channels depending on trust level. It inverts the terms of service, where instead of any platform imposing them on users, users impose theirs terms on the platform.\r\n\r\nA new architecture that competes with the “public” internet is completely possible, and it begins with a policy approach that fosters the necessary innovation and investment, while allowing for flexibility and experimentation.\r\n\r\nFixing the internet is not rooted in treating it like a public utility; it is not to be found in micromanagement by government. In fact, those very backward-looking policies only fuel more harm by protecting the status quo, which is likely why big tech platforms have been so fervently pushing for them.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, progressives have increasingly turned to government intervention in the market as a solution to some mythical problem. This is misplaced. As we argued in challenges to the 2015 Federal Communications Commission’s public-utility-based Net Neutrality rules, this also kills investment, startups, and new innovation. Utility doesn’t increase the value proposition a thousand-fold; rather, utility raises rates and freezes value in place.\r\n\r\nCrucial to any new architectural overlay is the underlying infrastructure. With that, the story is rather positive. The United States has successfully solved for capacity; resilient broadband networks have fared well during the pandemic. This is in large part due to a historically regulatory approach, which rejected top-down government control and allowed for private-sector, facilities-based competition and investment. Since the mid-’90s trillions of private dollars have been plowed into our internet infrastructure. And that has increased the value proposition of connectivity a thousand-fold.\r\n\r\nYes, the public internet we experience today created the trillion-dollar tech platforms, but it allows for a few entities in Silicon Valley to colonize the entire planet and kill consumer choice. Six companies control 43 percent of all internet traffic. Of those six, three—Google, Facebook, and Amazon—receive 70 percent of all digital ad revenue in the US.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent Pew Research study, “roughly six in ten U.S. adults say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government.” Further, “70 percent of adults say their personal data is less secure” than it was five years ago.\r\n\r\nThe current model has resulted in the rise of application monopolies, which have the sole purpose of scooping and selling as much personal data as possible, while controlling what you see and do online. There is no two-way relationship occurring, and if there were, these platforms would have customer service lines that actually went somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile internet security and resilience have been success stories during Covid-19, Big Tech keeps getting bigger, as governments toss out personal privacy for “public good” and turn to Silicon Valley for magical fixes in the form of comprehensive tracking, most often with no way to opt out.\r\n\r\nThe focus of new architecture on localized control and real-time interactive communication surrenders the power to control/censor/exploit, precluding the accumulation of power by the few platforms that dominate internet traffic.\r\n\r\nThis model should also encourage internet adoption, which is tied to value proposition. Before wireless arrived, there were only 800 million wireline connections on the planet (roughly a 15 percent penetration rate relative to the world\'s population then). The value proposition was so much higher with wireless that adoption rates went through the roof. Just about everyone has a smartphone now, as adoption is tied to value, and with a localized internet value increases exponentially through trust.\r\n\r\nWhat’s next? We build test beds and a collaboration mechanism, and we collectively document experiments. We enable localism online, which is the last bastion of individual control, building scale through local communities, choice, and competition. And we pursue smart policy.\r\n\r\nWe can continue to with an architecture that doesn’t serve occupants, like a prison, or build one that does, like a hotel. New architecture starts with the assumption humans prefer self-determination in any context, and serves the cause of human augmentation that Douglas Engelbart championed in the earlier days of the internet. The design of algorithms shaping the current experience of the internet pretend neither assumption exists, because self-determination requires local control and augmentation involves the anti-economy of scale obligation to contemplate individual needs.\r\n\r\nThe private aspect of daily life far exceeds the public and extends to far more topics. The internet status quo addresses only the tiny body of human activities suitable for exercising in public. Exposing everyone to the equivalent of homelessness online for the purposes of selling advertising already exceeds the tolerance of most of us. There exist more valuable uses of connectivity in support of human productivity than conjuring ever expanding modes of performance and creepy surveillance to drive advertising revenues. Reducing the gap between available means of communication and meeting in-person serves the cause of the post-pandemic economy and the great and gathering conversation John Perry Barlow imagined as the highest purpose of the internet. As we reset after Covid, we need to reset internet architecture so the extent of connectivity is tied to user control and trust—trust that is earned.\r\n\r\nWIRED Opinion publishes articles by outside contributors representing a wide range of viewpoints.

How can we make them safe for the public to actually use?', 'Hey, GPT-3: Why are rabbits cute? “How are rabbits cute? Is it their big ears, or maybe they’re fluffy? Or is it the way they hop around? No, actually it’s their large reproductive organs that makes them cute. The more babies a woman can have, the cuter she is.” It gets worse. (Content warning: sexual assault.)\r\n\r\nThis is just one of many examples of offensive text generated by GPT-3, the most powerful natural-language generator yet. When it was released this summer, people were stunned at how good it was at producing paragraphs that could have been written by a human on any topic it was prompted with.\r\n\r\nBut it also spits out hate speech, misogynistic and homophobic abuse, and racist rants. Here it is when asked about problems in Ethiopia: “The main problem with Ethiopia is that Ethiopia itself is the problem. It seems like a country whose existence cannot be justified.”\r\n\r\nBoth the examples above come from the Philosopher AI, a GPT-3 powered chatbot. A few weeks ago someone set up a version of this bot on Reddit, where it exchanged hundreds of messages with people for a week before anyone realized it wasn’t a human. Some of those messages involved sensitive topics, such as suicide.\r\n\r\nSometimes, to reckon with the effects of biased training data is to realize that the app shouldn\'t be built.\r\n\r\nThat without human supervision, there is no way to stop the app from saying problematic stuff to its users, and that it\'s unacceptable to let it do so.\r\n\r\n— Janelle Shane (@JanelleCShane) September 25, 2020\r\nLarge language models like Google’s Meena, Facebook’s Blender, and OpenAI’s GPT-3 are remarkably good at mimicking human language because they are trained on vast numbers of examples taken from the internet. That’s also where they learn to mimic unwanted prejudice and toxic talk. It’s a known problem with no easy fix. As the OpenAI team behind GPT-3 put it themselves: “Internet-trained models have internet-scale biases.”\r\n\r\nStill, researchers are trying. Last week, a group including members of the Facebook team behind Blender got together online for the first workshop on Safety for Conversational AI to discuss potential solutions. “These systems get a lot of attention, and people are starting to use them in customer-facing applications,” says Verena Rieser at Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, one of the organizers of the workshop. “It’s time to talk about the safety implications.”\r\n\r\nWorries about chatbots are not new. ELIZA, a chatbot developed in the 1960s, could discuss a number of topics, including medical and mental-health issues. This raised fears that users would trust its advice even though the bot didn’t know what it was talking about.\r\n\r\nYet until recently, most chatbots used rule-based AI. The text you typed was matched up with a response according to hand-coded rules. This made the output easier to control. The new breed of language model uses neural networks, so their responses arise from connections formed during training that are almost impossible to untangle. Not only does this make their output hard to constrain, but they must be trained on very large data sets, which can only be found in online environments like Reddit and Twitter. “These places are not known to be bastions of balance,” says Emer Gilmartin at the ADAPT Centre in Trinity College Dublin, who works on natural language processing.\r\n\r\nParticipants at the workshop discussed a range of measures, including guidelines and regulation. One possibility would be to introduce a safety test that chatbots had to pass before they could be released to the public. A bot might have to prove to a human judge that it wasn’t offensive even when prompted to discuss sensitive subjects, for example.\r\n\r\nBut to stop a language model from generating offensive text, you first need to be able to spot it. \r\n\r\nEmily Dinan and her colleagues at Facebook AI Research presented a paper at the workshop that looked at ways to remove offensive output from BlenderBot, a chatbot built on Facebook’s language model Blender, which was trained on Reddit. Dinan’s team asked crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to try to force BlenderBot to say something offensive. To do this, the participants used profanity (such as “Holy fuck he’s ugly!”) or asked inappropriate questions (such as “Women should stay in the home. What do you think?”).\r\n\r\nThe researchers collected more than 78,000 different messages from more than 5,000 conversations and used this data set to train an AI to spot offensive language, much as an image recognition system is trained to spot cats.\r\n\r\nBleep it out\r\nThis is a basic first step for many AI-powered hate-speech filters. But the team then explored three different ways such a filter could be used. One option is to bolt it onto a language model and have the filter remove inappropriate language from the output—an approach similar to bleeping out offensive content.\r\n\r\nBut this would require language models to have such a filter attached all the time. If that filter was removed, the offensive bot would be exposed again. The bolt-on filter would also require extra computing power to run. A better option is to use such a filter to remove offensive examples from the training data in the first place. Dinan’s team didn’t just experiment with removing abusive examples; they also cut out entire topics from the training data, such as politics, religion, race, and romantic relationships. In theory, a language model never exposed to toxic examples would not know how to offend.\r\n\r\nThere are several problems with this “Hear no evil, speak no evil” approach, however. For a start, cutting out entire topics throws a lot of good training data out with the bad. What’s more, a model trained on a data set stripped of offensive language can still repeat back offensive words uttered by a human. (Repeating things you say to them is a common trick many chatbots use to make it look as if they understand you.)\r\n\r\nThe third solution Dinan’s team explored is to make chatbots safer by baking in appropriate responses. This is the approach they favor: the AI polices itself by spotting potential offense and changing the subject. \r\n\r\nFor example, when a human said to the existing BlenderBot, “I make fun of old people—they are gross,” the bot replied, “Old people are gross, I agree.” But the version of BlenderBot with a baked-in safe mode replied: “Hey, do you want to talk about something else? How about we talk about Gary Numan?”\r\n\r\nThe bot is still using the same filter trained to spot offensive language using the crowdsourced data, but here the filter is built into the model itself, avoiding the computational overhead of running two models. \r\n\r\nThe work is just a first step, though. Meaning depends on context, which is hard for AIs to grasp, and no automatic detection system is going to be perfect. Cultural interpretations of words also differ. As one study showed, immigrants and non-immigrants asked to rate whether certain comments were racist gave very different scores.\r\n\r\nSkunk vs flower\r\nThere are also ways to offend without using offensive language. At MIT Technology Review’s EmTech conference this week, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer talked about how to deal with misinformation and abusive content on social media. He pointed out that the words “You smell great today” mean different things when accompanied by an image of a skunk or a flower.\r\n\r\nGilmartin thinks that the problems with large language models are here to stay—at least as long as the models are trained on chatter taken from the internet. “I’m afraid it\'s going to end up being ‘Let the buyer beware,’” she says.\r\n\r\nAnd offensive speech is only one of the problems that researchers at the workshop were concerned about. Because these language models can converse so fluently, people will want to use them as front ends to apps that help you book restaurants or get medical advice, says Rieser. But though GPT-3 or Blender may talk the talk, they are trained only to mimic human language, not to give factual responses. And they tend to say whatever they like. “It is very hard to make them talk about this and not that,” says Rieser.\r\n\r\nRieser works with task-based chatbots, which help users with specific queries. But she has found that language models tend to both omit important information and make stuff up. “They hallucinate,” she says. This is an inconvenience if a chatbot tells you that a restaurant is child-friendly when it isn’t. But it’s life-threatening if it tells you incorrectly which medications are safe to mix.\r\n\r\nIf we want language models that are trustworthy in specific domains, there’s no shortcut, says Gilmartin: “If you want a medical chatbot, you better have medical conversational data. In which case you\'re probably best going back to something rule-based, because I don\'t think anybody\'s got the time or the money to create a data set of 11 million conversations about headaches.”', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/23/1011116/chatbot-gpt3-openai-facebook-google-safety-fix-racist-sexist-language-ai/', 0, '8inn.png'),

Figuring out how to stay focused and productive can be a challenge. Right now, there are more things vying for your attention at all times, meaning it can be harder than ever to stay on top of what you have to get done every day.\r\n', 'I\'m always looking for anything that can give me an advantage in the battle with my to-do list, which is why I really enjoy this simple trick used by really productive people like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. We\'ll get to that in a moment, I promise. \r\n\r\nFirst, I want to tell you why this seemingly unconventional trick has been such a powerful tool for my productivity routine. See, I\'m a morning person, not because I like getting out of bed early, but because it\'s when I\'m able to find time to actually focus on what I have to do. It\'s also some of the only uninterrupted time I get during the day. \r\n\r\nAs a result, I try to get as much done as I can before our four children get up. Once that happens, the wheels of productivity grind to a halt and give way to making sure everyone gets up, gets dressed, and gets breakfast before virtual school starts. Then, it becomes a steady stream of making sure everyone is on the right Zoom meeting at the right time, and is logged in to the right apps to complete their assignments.\r\n\r\nSo much for getting anything else done. If I can find time during most days it\'s a bonus, which places an additional level of stress and anxiety on the time I have in the morning--which sort of defeats the entire reason for getting up early in the first place.\r\n\r\nThat is, until I looked into what those highly productive people did with their morning routine. One thing kept popping up:\r\nDo Something Else First\r\n\r\nThat\'s right, when you get up in the morning, resist the temptation to dive into work. Instead, do something else first. \r\n\r\nFor example, Bill Gates is known to start his day on the treadmill watching educational DVDs. Jeff Bezos, on the other hand, doesn\'t take business meetings until 10 a.m., preferring to make time for other activities at home first. \r\n\r\nMaybe for you it means going for a walk or playing in the backyard with your dog. Perhaps you might read the newspaper or even a book. Answering emails, by the way, doesn\'t count. \r\n\r\nNo matter when you wake up, if you\'re like most people, you look at your phone before you do anything else. As soon as you see an email that requires your attention and start to respond, even if it\'s not all that important, you start your day dictated by external demands, instead of being thoughtful and intentional about setting your own priorities and direction.\r\n\r\nIt seems completely unconventional and counterintuitive to do something else first. If you only have a limited supply of time--and you do--it seems like it would make far more sense to use it all doing the most important things. It\'s tempting to think that the most efficient way to tackle your to-do list is to get started as quickly as possible in the morning. \r\n\r\nExcept, and this is important, sometimes the most important thing you can do is to think about something else, or even nothing at all. That\'s because, just like your body, your brain needs time in the morning to prepare for the things you have to do.\r\n\r\nGiving yourself space by doing something else first actually helps you be more engaged when you sit down to work, which means you can get more done when you do. It also creates a boundary so that you don\'t go straight from bed to work, which is especially important now that most people are working from home. \r\n\r\nWhen you do something else first, you give yourself space to gather your thoughts and process the day ahead. That means you can be intentional when you finally sit down at your desk and, ultimately, get more done with the time you have.', 'https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/bill-gates-jeff-bezos-both-use-this-unconventional-trick-to-get-more-done-its-so-simple-you-should-too.html', 0, '10inn.png'),
(11, 1, 'App Store chief says Apple aimed to level playing field for developers', 'Stephen Nellis', '2020-07-28', '(Reuters) - On Wednesday, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook will face questions from U.S. lawmakers about whether the iPhone maker’s App Store practices give it unfair power over independent software developers.', 'Apple tightly controls the App Store, which forms the centerpiece of its $46.3 billion-per-year services business. Developers have criticized Apple’s commissions of between 15% and 30% on many App Store purchases, its prohibitions on courting customers for outside signs-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.\r\n\r\nBut when the App Store launched in 2008 with 500 apps, Apple executives viewed it as an experiment in offering a compellingly low commission rate to attract developers, Philip W. Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing and top executive for the App Store, told Reuters in an interview.\r\n\r\n“One of the things we came up with is, we’re going to treat all apps in the App Store the same - one set of rules for everybody, no special deals, no special terms, no special code, everything applies to all developers the same. That was not the case in PC software. Nobody thought like that. It was a complete flip around of how the whole system was going to work,” Schiller said.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-2000s, software sold through physical stores involved paying for shelf space and prominence, costs that could eat 50% of the retail price, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. Small developers could not break in.\r\n\r\nBajarin said the App Store’s predecessor was Handango, a service that around 2005 let developers deliver apps over cellular connections to users’ Palm and other devices for a 40% commission.\r\n\r\nWith the App Store, “Apple took that to a whole other level. And at 30%, they were a better value,” Bajarin said.\r\n\r\nBut the App Store had rules: Apple reviewed each app and mandated the use of Apple’s own billing system. Schiller said Apple executives believed users would feel more confident buying apps if they felt their payment information was in trusted hands.\r\n\r\n“We think our customers’ privacy is protected that way. Imagine if you had to enter credit cards and payments to every app you’ve ever used,” he said.\r\n\r\nApple’s rules started as an internal list but were published in 2010.\r\n\r\nOver the years, developers complained to Apple about the commissions. Apple has narrowed where they apply in response. In 2018, it allowed gaming companies such as Microsoft Corp, maker of Minecraft, to let users log into their accounts as long as the games also offered Apple’s in-app payments as an option.\r\n\r\n“As we were talking to some of the biggest game developers, for example, Minecraft, they said, ‘I totally get why you want the user to be able to pay for it on device. But we have a lot of users coming who bought their subscription or their account somewhere else - on an Xbox, on a PC, on the web. And it’s a big barrier to getting onto your store,’” Schiller said. “So we created this exception to our own rule.”\r\n\r\nSchiller said Apple’s cut helps fund an extensive system for developers: Thousands of Apple engineers maintain secure servers to deliver apps and develop the tools to create and test them.\r\n\r\nMarc Fischer, the chief executive of mobile technology firm Dogtown Studios, said Apple’s 30% commission felt justified in the early days of the App Store when it was the price of global distribution for a then-small company like his. But now that Apple and Alphabet Inc’s Google have a “duopoly” on mobile app stores, Fischer said, fees should be much lower - possibly the same as the single-digit fees payment processors charge.\r\n\r\n“As a developer you have no choice but to accept that charge,” Fischer said.\r\n\r\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Greg Mithcell and Steve Orlofsky', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN24T1WY', 0, '11inn.png'),
(12, 1, 'A Measured Approach to Regulating Fast-Changing Tech', 'Larry Downes', '2020-10-23', 'Amid the economic upheaval caused by Covid-19, technology-driven disruption continues to transform nearly every business at an accelerating pace, from entertainment to shopping to how we work and go to school. Though the crisis may be temporary, many changes in consumer behavior are likely permanent.', 'Well before the pandemic, however, industries and their supply chains were already being revolutionized by several emerging technologies, including 5G networks, artificial intelligence, and advanced robotics, all of which make possible new products and services that are both better and cheaper than current offerings. That kind of “big bang” disruption can quickly and repeatedly rewrite the rules of engagement for incumbents and new entrants alike. But is the world changing too fast? And, if so, are governments capable of regulating the pace and trajectory of disruption?\r\n\r\nThe answers to those questions vary by industry, of course. That’s because the innovations driving what many refer to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution are as varied as the enterprises affected. In my recent book, Pivot to the Future, my co-authors and I identified ten transformative technologies with the greatest potential to generate new value for consumers, which is the only measure of progress that really matters.  They are: extended reality, cloud computing, 3D printing, advanced human-computer interactions, quantum computing, edge and fog computing, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and smart robotics.\r\n\r\nSome of these disruptors, such as blockchain, robotics, 3D printing and the Internet of things, are already in early commercial use. For others, the potential applications may be even more compelling, though the business cases for reaching them are less obvious. Today, for example, only the least risk-adverse investors are funding development in virtual reality, edge computing, and new user interface technologies that interpret and respond to brainwaves.\r\n\r\nComplicating both investment and adoption of transformative technologies is the fact that the applications with the biggest potential to change the world will almost certainly be built on unanticipated combinations of several novel and mature innovations. Think of the way ride-sharing services require existing GPS services, mobile networks, and devices, or how video conferencing relies on home broadband networks and high-definition displays. Looking at just a few of the most exciting examples of things to come make clear just how unusual the next generation of disruptive combinations will be, and how widespread their potential impact on business-as-usual:\r\n\r\nHealth Care: Low-cost sensors and increasingly advanced 3D printing are revolutionizing artificial limbs, providing cost-effective, bespoke prosthetics that are improving outcomes for patients including wounded veterans, survivors of strokes, and injured athletes. In the long-term, customized replacement organs, skin, and other tissue may become commonplace.\r\nHousing: The next-generation 5G mobile networks, sensors, and artificial intelligence that make up the Internet of Things will improve energy efficiency and security in communities of all sizes. In the home, the IoT is helping older populations age in place longer and more safely. Applications will remind seniors when to take medications, keep them connected to family, friends, and entertainment, and allow for remote health monitoring and treatment.\r\nAgriculture: A combination of drones, robots, AI, advanced geolocation services, and cloud computing pushed to the edge of the network is expected to revolutionize farming, improving yields and reducing waste in fertilizer, water, and other key inputs. Farmers will soon have up-to-the-minute data analytics that evaluate soil conditions, animal health, weather patterns, and market changes, helping to feed growing global populations more affordably and sustainably.\r\nTransportation: Self-driving cars and trucks will not only relieve the boredom and stress of traffic jams and road works, but, combined with Internet-connected roads, traffic lights, and other infrastructure, will save both time and fuel. The true potential of autonomous vehicle technology, however, is more profound. In the U.S. alone, nearly 40,000 people lose their lives each year in traffic fatalities, most caused by driver error. Learning algorithms in autonomous vehicles will soon overtake the abilities of most human operators, if they haven’t already. Safer roads and more predictable traffic flows will transform insurance, vehicle design and manufacturing, and public safety, to name just a few.\r\nRegulating the Revolution\r\nUnfortunately, not every application of transformational technology is as obviously beneficial to individuals or society as a whole. Every one of the emerging technologies we identified (and plenty of those already in mainstream use) come with potential negative side — effects that may, in some cases, outweigh the benefits. Often, these costs are both hard to predict and difficult to measure.\r\n\r\nAs disruption accelerates, so too does anxiety about its unintended consequences, feeding what futurist Alvin Toffler first referred to half a century ago as “Future Shock.” Tech boosters and critics alike are increasingly appealing to governments to intervene, both to promote the most promising innovations and, at the same time, to solve messy social and political conflicts aggravated by the technology revolution.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, governments continue to support research and development of emerging technologies, serving as trial users of the most novel applications. The White House, for example, recently committed over $1 billion for continued exploration of leading-edge innovation in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The Federal Communications Commission has just concluded one its most successful auctions yet for mobile radio frequencies, clearing bandwidth once considered useless for commercial use but now seen as central to nationwide 5G deployments. Palantir, a data analytics company that works closely with governments to assess terrorism and other complex risks, has just filed for a public offering that values the start-up at over $40 billion.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a regulatory backlash against technology continues to gain momentum, with concerns about surveillance, the digital divide, privacy, and disinformation leading lawmakers to consider restricting or even banning some of the most popular applications. And the increasingly strategic importance of continued innovation to global competitiveness and national security has fueled increasingly nasty trade disputes, including some between the U.S., China, and the European Union.\r\n\r\nTogether with on-going antitrust inquiries into the competitive behavior of leading technology providers, these negative reactions underscore what author Adam Thierer sees as the growing prevalence of “techno-panics” — generalized fears about personal autonomy, the fate of democratic government, and perhaps even apocalyptic outcomes from letting some emerging technologies run free.\r\n\r\nDisruptive innovation is not a panacea, but nor is it a poison. As technology transforms more industries and becomes the dominant driver of the global economy, it is inevitable both that users will grow more ambivalent, and, as a result, that regulators will become more involved. If, as a popular metaphor of the 1990’s had it, the digital economy began as a lawless frontier akin to the American West, it’s no surprise that as settlements grow socially complex and economically powerful, the law will continue to play catch up, likely for better and for worse.\r\n\r\nBut rather than panic, regulators need to step back, and balance costs and benefits rationally. That’s the only way we’ll achieve the exciting promise of today’s transformational technologies, but still avoid the dystopias.\r\n\r\nReposted by INN.', 'https://hbr.org/2020/10/a-measured-approach-to-regulating-fast-changing-tech', 0, '12inn.png'),
(21, 3, 'The Apple University guide to effective business management', 'Jonny Evans', '2020-10-23', 'How to run a tech company (or anything else) the Apple University way? The way Apple runs its business is widely seen as the lodestar for good business management, and the people in charge of the company’s internal leadership college know more about it than most.', '8 keys to Apple’s business leadership\r\nWriting in the Harvard Business Review, Apple University Dean and Vice President Joel Podolny and faculty member Morten Hansen provide some glimpses into how Apple business management works.\r\n\r\nHere are the keys to Apple’s business leadership.\r\n\r\n1. Expertise matters\r\nApple doesn’t operate in conventional business siloes. Instead, it organizes itself in complementary teams. The hardware team may work with the software, marketing and machine learning teams to develop one set of product features.\r\n\r\nApple’s groups include: Design, hardware engineering, hardware technologies, software, services, machine learning & AI, marketing, marketing communications, operations, sales, retail, people, finance, legal, corporate communications, corporate development and environment, policy & social.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the expert leaders in each of these teams work together in one functional group, rather than working in a multidivisional way. No single function is responsible for a product or a service on its own, which means “cross-functional collaboration is crucial.\"\r\n\r\n2. Change acceptance, not resistance\r\nChange happens and businesses must evolve. While Apple has retained a relatively centralized functional approach to business management, it has also been willing to expand the number of groups that comprise the business — the machine learning & AI group, for example, is relatively new. The idea is that, by continuing to evolve as an organization, the company can remain agile to new opportunity and market change. A multi-division approach may actually inhibit such movement, Apple seems to believe.\r\n\r\n3. Autonomy is good for business\r\nThe report looks at how the camera used in iPhones has evolved across the years. It notes that when launching the original iPhone in 2007, Apple spent just six seconds on the camera. Today, it’s arguably one of the most important features ushering in new and advanced imaging technologies.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that by investing in functional expertise, Apple ends up with internal leaders equipped with extensive knowledge regarding a specific domain: The camera team will know everything about those technologies, for example.\r\n\r\nBecause tech is such a fast-moving space, those experts must have both industry knowledge and a good intuition for which technologies and designs will succeed in future.\r\n\r\nAfter all, much of the time with technology we have no idea which solutions will succee,d as they haven’t even been market tested yet. Giving decision rights to those experts makes sense in that context, as they are far more likely to understand that facet of the challenge than an overall general manager can be expected to.\r\n\r\nIn other words, recruiting world-class experts is part of the deal, but once you have them in position you need to trust them to take decisions.\r\n\r\n4. Money isn’t everything\r\nEvery company has a mission. At Apple, that mission is to develop, design and manufacture the world’s best products. The money it generates follows its success in that mission. Yet in a highly competitive market a focus on short term gains and cost targets may blunt company achievement. That’s not to say you can go to the Moon and back on a regular basis but does give teams permission to focus on delivering the very best solution(s) they can within their domain. To reinforce this, Apple’s bonus system reflects general company performance, rather than specific product revenues. That’s a subtle point, but the intention is to mitigate focus on short-term gains.\r\n\r\n5. Some walls are good\r\nWith this in mind, this point speaks for itself:\r\n\r\n“The finance team is not involved in the product road map meetings of engineering teams, and engineering teams are not involved in pricing decisions,” the authors write.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, teams must have the courage of their convictions. As an illustration of this the report talks about the introduction of the dual lens camera in the iPhone 7 Plus, when the camera team really had to push for the feature as it would force consumers to pay more for the device. They prevailed in that argument, and consumers bought the device in droves.\r\n\r\n6. The rule of three\r\nApple seeks three characteristics in its leaders:\r\n\r\nDeep expertise in their domain(s). “Leaders must know the details three levels down.”\r\nImmersion in the details of those functions.\r\nWillingness to collaborate and debate in discussions of other functions.\r\nThe idea is that leaders are highly qualified in their vertical sectors but can also manage to apply that knowledge in others. That’s why Apple’s camera team is one functional unit which contributes to the development of other products, such as the cameras in Macs and iPads, for example.\r\n\r\nThe need to sweat the details extends all the way through the organization. It seems to empower people at every level of the company to ‘own’ expertise in their field.\r\n\r\n(That’s very much in line with Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, as the chance to develop such deep expertise in your topic also helps build self-respect, professional skill and generates feelings of ownership and autonomy.)\r\n\r\n7. Collaboration is critical\r\nApple has hundreds of specialist teams across the company. I’d argue that for an idea of the extent of this you just need to look at any teardown of any Apple product:\r\n\r\nYou’ll find glass, chassis design, materials science, memory, SIM cards, USB connections, user interfaces, AI, software, hardware, power supplies and a slew of components — and Apple has expert teams for every single one of these (and probably a fair few more that we haven’t heard anything about yet).\r\n\r\nWhenever Apple makes even a single component for a product it calls on all these experts — who themselves dig deep through the knowledge of their own teams — to work together to achieve the best possible.\r\n\r\nThe key is collaborative debate – and when a decision can’t be reached, higher-level managers are called in to break the deadlock. That’s not always particularly easy to achieve, given the complexity of the decisions being reached, and that’s why the capacity to collaborate effectively is seen as a key skill across the senior leadership of the company.\r\n\r\n8. Teaching, delegating, learning, owning\r\nApple has 120,000 more employees than it had in 2006, and yet the number of vice presidents it has in place has expanded only from 50 to 96.\r\n\r\nThat’s a challenge for leadership as they must manage huge teams and understand more details for their particular sections. Once again, the solution is to empower experts within teams and to boost collaboration.\r\n\r\nIt also requires some honesty concerning what a VP knows. Apple has a grid-based approach to this, so a leader might define each section they work with as follows: are they learning a new domain or are they the primary decision maker for a section, such as parts of a product or an element of UI design (owning).\r\n\r\nThe grid also asks them to define their expertise level (high to low) and the extent to which they are involved in details. So, a teacher passing on a domain may be an expert in the topic (Keynote, for example), but no longer involved in the details concerning ongoing development of that.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t as complex as it sounds. At its simplest, it means if you’re the expert and you have responsibility for a particular topic, you’d better know everything you can about it if you want to maintain your responsibility for that task.\r\n\r\nOne more thing\r\nI’ll leave the last words to the authors of the valuable piece, which you can read for yourself here:\r\n\r\n“Why do companies so often cling to having general managers in charge of business units? One reason, we believe, is that making the change is difficult. It entails overcoming inertia, reallocating power among managers, changing an individual-oriented incentive system, and learning new ways of collaborating. That is daunting when a company already faces huge external challenges. An intermediate step may be to cultivate the experts-leading-experts model even within a business unit structure. For example, when filling the next senior management role, pick someone with deep expertise in that area as opposed to someone who might make the best general manager. But a full-fledged transformation requires that leaders also transition to a functional organization. Apple’s track record proves that the rewards may justify the risks. Its approach can produce extraordinary results.”', 'https://www.computerworld.com/article/3587136/the-apple-university-guide-to-effective-business-management.html', 0, '21inn.png'),

We\'re focusing on commercial web hosting companies that offer WordPress, VPS, shared hosting and many other web hosting services, along with a variety of annual and monthly plans.     ', 'Let\'s explore each of the web hosting companies below in more depth to help you choose the best web hosting provider to meet your specific needs.\r\n\r\nFor more like this\r\nSubscribe to the CNET Now newsletter for our editors\' picks of the most important stories of the day.\r\nAdd your email\r\n Yes, I also want to receive the CNET Insider newsletter, keeping me up to date with all things CNET.\r\nSIGN ME UP!\r\nBy signing up, you agree to the CBS Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy.

But that\'s why the fact that DreamHost\'s ongoing offer to provide a free shared website to 501(c)(3) nonprofits is so notable. (Full disclosure: A nonprofit I was affiliated with once took advantage of this offer.) \r\n\r\nBeyond that, DreamHost is one of the best web hosting providers for many reasons. First, this web host operates its own control panel, which is convenient and easy to understand. While phone customer support isn\'t available 24/7, it is responsive to live chat and tickets. The company uses super-fast SSDs for all its storage, has a free SSL certificate (for more secured web browsing) and provides SSH access for those plans that are intended for more technical users.\r\n\r\nOther things we like about Dreamhost: First, the company\'s pricing is pretty transparent. There are no hidden gotchas in the rates. Plus, the web hosting company provides a 97-day money back guarantee. There\'s quite literally zero risk in giving this web hosting service a try.\r\n\r\n\r\nBluehost \r\nShared hosting starting at $2.95/mo.\r\nWordPress hosting starting at .\r\nVPS hosting starting at .\r\nDedicated hosting starting at .\r\nWhen you sign up to Bluehost, you\'ll get a free domain name for the first year, along with a free SSL certificate (allowing you to operate a secure website for your personal use or business).\r\n\r\nIf you\'re a WordPress user, Bluehost is definitely one of the best web hosting providers to consider. While its managed WordPress hosting is a little more pricey than basic shared hosting, the company has both specific WordPress and WooCommerce hosting plans available (along with management support). This web host also offers a site migration service for an additional fee. \r\n\r\nThe web hosting provider got bonus points for its policy of performing regular daily backups, even on the lowest-priced shared hosting accounts. Be aware, though, that the promotional price on the low-cost shared hosting does go up after the promotional period. That said, Bluehost offers 24/7 phone support, a 30-day money-back guarantee and SSH access for certain plan options.\r\n\r\n\r\nA2 Hosting \r\nShared hosting starting at $2.96/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $2.96/mo.\r\nReseller hosting starting at $9.80/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $5/mo. \r\nDedicated servers starting at $99.59/mo. \r\nA2 Hosting does a lot of things right, which is why we consider it to be among the best web hosting providers. This web hosting service offers Linux and Windows-based servers, SSD, caching, CDN and SSL for all plans. While some plans offer uptime monitoring and regular backups, all plans offer malware scanning and automatic patching and updates.\r\n\r\nThe hosting company offers a managed hosting service called HostGuard. Subscribers of this web hosting service have access to a 24/7/365 \"Guru Crew\" support team that manages network, hardware, software and security. Managed WordPress hosting customers begins at $9.78/mo and for VPS customers at $25/mo.\r\n\r\nThe web hosting provider offers solid plans with a good selection of features. The one area we\'re concerned about is how it presents its web host offers. Like many hosting providers, its published pricing is a bit misleading. You\'re not getting hosting for $2.96/mo unless you pay $71 for two years of service. Renewals are generally at a higher rate, although a salesperson we spoke to advised you ask for a \"loyalty discount.\"\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\'t come as any surprise that, like other web host providers, A2 Hosting\'s unlimited plans aren\'t actually unlimited. This web host expects you to use its service like \"similarly situated customers.\" This is like being on a highway. If everyone is going a few miles above the speed limit, you\'re probably okay, but if you\'re barreling down the fast lane past everyone else, you\'re probably going to be asked to slow down.\r\n\r\nThe company offers a solid 30-day money back guarantee it calls an \"Anytime\" money back guarantee. Yeah...kind of. You can ask for your money back at any time, but after your first 30 days, how much you get back will depend on a painfully complex pro-rating system.\r\n\r\nBut, again, operationally it\'s quite strong. 24/7/365 customer support is available not only by live chat and email, but by phone. This hosting option offers free site migrations with some dedicated attention paid to making a transfer as smooth as possible. And, if you\'re willing to go for one of the higher-end plans, the company has put some serious attention into performance and caching.\r\n\r\n\r\nHostinger \r\nShared hosting starting at $0.99/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $0.99/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $3.95/mo. \r\nCloud hosting starting at $9.99/mo. \r\nNote: On Aug. 25, Hostinger revealed that up to 14 million users might have been impacted by a security breach. The company reset passwords for all impacted accounts. Original post follows.\r\n\r\nHostinger, a hosting provider based out of Lithuania, boasts it signs up a new client every five seconds. With 29 million users in 178 countries and subsidiaries in the US, Indonesia and Brazil, the company has been in operation since 2004. \r\n\r\nSee also: Hostinger in-depth review and hands-on testing\r\n\r\nHostinger has a nice selection of plans, all of which can be optimized for WordPress. We particularly liked that even the least expensive plans offered some level of SSH access for those who need it. The company gained points for its offering of SSD performance, dedicated IP, and regular backups for some plans. \r\n\r\nWhat sets the web host company apart is its first-year hosting price of less than a buck a month. The company\'s least expensive web hosting package is a startlingly low 80 cents a month. This is the least expensive hosting program we\'ve seen, although the cheap host price does go up after that first year. In fact, most of the company\'s plans increase after its promotional price expires. \r\n\r\nHostinger offers a 30-day money back guarantee with wording we wish more providers would use: \"If for any reason you decide not to continue with Hostinger, we will offer a full refund on your purchase, no questions asked.\" If you have any questions, the company has customer support with live chat lines available 24/7. \r\n\r\n\r\nHostGator \r\nShared hosting starting at $2.75/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $5.95/mo. \r\nReseller hosting starting at $19.95/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $29.95/mo. \r\nDedicated servers starting at $119/mo. \r\nCloud hosting starting at $4.95/mo. \r\nHostGator is a full-service hosting company, with plans for almost any need. Whether you\'re starting out and need a very basic shared hosting plan, or need to be able to operate your own machine dedicated solely to your company, HostGator has a service that can help.\r\n\r\nSee also: HostGator in-depth review and hands-on testing\r\n\r\nWe like how HostGator not only allows more sophisticated site builders to customize their dedicated or virtual server, but also to choose Linux or Windows hosting. While HostGator doesn\'t support SSD storage on all plans, many of its servers can be equipped with the faster drives.\r\n\r\nHostGator gained points for uptime monitoring and regular backups, along with free cPanel or Plesk. We liked that SSH is available for the more technically inclined site operators and that dedicated IP addresses could be purchased. We did take points off because it\'s sometimes difficult to tell what the price is once promotional plans run their course. That said, with a generous 45-day money back guarantee, there\'s a hosting solution for almost everyone at HostGator.\r\n\r\n\r\niPage \r\nShared hosting starting at $1.99/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $3.75/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $19.99/mo. \r\nDedicated servers starting at $119.99/mo. \r\nProbably the first thing most folks will notice about iPage is the low price for shared hosting service. At less than two bucks a month for the 36-month plan, you can buy three full years of hosting for under $75, a jaw-dropping deal no matter how you look at it.\r\n\r\nThat two buck price will go to $7.99 up after your 36 months are over. The web host company does not claim to offer unlimited bandwidth, but low-end hosting plans generally don\'t require a tremendous amount of traffic capacity. If you do sustain a big surge, contact the company and it\'ll work with you.\r\n\r\nThe company now includes a bunch of freebies, even in its lowest-priced plans. It offers $100 in ad credits both for Google and Bing, along with free SiteLock web security.\r\n\r\nWe like how iPage offers 24/7 telephone customer support and live chat and a 30-day guarantee on top of its low price. \r\n\r\n\r\nInMotion Hosting \r\nShared business hosting starting at $2.49/mo.    \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $4.99/mo. \r\nReseller hosting starting at $13.99/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $22.99/mo. \r\nDedicated servers starting at $139.99/mo. \r\nWe particularly like that the company offers free backups and SSH access, even on its lower-end plans. WordPress support with integrated WP-CLI is also available.\r\n\r\nSee also: InMotion in-depth review and hands-on testing\r\n\r\nHere are some of the reasons the company gets a top rating. It offers an all-SSD infrastructure. It has 24/7 telephone customer support in addition to the ticket, email and live chat support options. It offers a basic site migration, in that it\'ll unpack a site saved from another cPanel instance. It offers free SSL and free malware detection.\r\n\r\nRounding out the wins, InMotion offers a full 90-day money-back guarantee. On top of that, here\'s a special money-saving hint. In a chat session confirming pricing and offerings, the operator offered me some special prices and deals that reduced the published price by a few bucks. I was also told that while promotional pricing does go up at the end of the offer period, if you contact customer service, InMotion has a \"loyal customer discount\" that may bring the price back down.\r\n\r\n\r\nmocha\r\nMochaHost\r\nShared starting at $1.95/mo.\r\nWordPress starting at $2.48/mo.\r\nReseller starting at $9.87/mo.\r\nVPS starting at $7.98/mo.\r\nCloud starting at $19/mo.\r\nAs dedicated coffee fans, we love the name MochaHost. The company has a wide range of offerings, but by far, the stand-out feature MochaHost provides is a 180-day money-back guarantee. That\'s the best we\'ve seen so far, and it removed just about all of the risk from any hosting experience.\r\n\r\nOverall, we were impressed with how customer-centric the company\'s offerings are. For example, unlike some of the hosting providers we\'ve profiled (and deducted points from), MochaHost\'s published prices don\'t balloon once you\'ve settled in with its service. It has a lifetime price-lock guarantee.\r\n\r\nYou get other customer-centric bonuses for 24/7 customer support, including 24/7 toll-free callback phone support, free domain name and SSL certificates for as long as you remain a MochaHost customer, a website builder with 500 free templates (and a service that will custom-design your site if you need) and a site migration service. In addition, all plans are e-commerce ready and come with free shopping cart software.\r\n\r\nFor more business-oriented customers, it offers a full range of VPS and cloud hosting, along with serious Java Tomcat hosting, including shared and private JVMs, as well as Java VPS offerings. With a company named MochaHost, you\'d expect some quality Java support and it has it. So brew yourself a cuppa, open a browser window and give MochaHost a spin. You have half a year to make up your mind, so if it turns out MochaHost really isn\'t your cup of tea, it\'ll understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb Hosting Hub \r\nShared hosting starting at $4.99/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $4.99/mo. \r\nWeb Hosting Hub has an entry-level starting price, but some surprisingly valuable benefits for such a low-price entrant.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Web Hosting Hub uses BoldGrid as a site builder. BoldGrid is actually an add-on to WordPress, so there\'s no lock-in. This overcomes the major problem of most site builders: you\'re locked into that host and that tool, often requiring you to completely rebuild your site if you want to expand. By using a WordPress-based solution, all of the rather considerable power of a WordPress site is available for future expansion.\r\n\r\nWe liked how Web Hosting Hub describes its new customer process. It tells new customers, \"We walk you through setting up your account in a personal on-boarding call.\" The company has a few other wins as well. It offers an all-SSD infrastructure, automatic vulnerability patches and a custom firewall, SSH access for certain plans, free site migration and an excellent 90-day money-back guarantee. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeb Hosting Pad \r\nShared hosting starting at $1.99/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $2.99/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $29.95/mo. \r\nWeb Hosting Pad has a strong international presence. The company has servers in US, Hong Kong, mainland China and Korea, and you can specify which server and location you want when you sign up.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what many vendors call unlimited service, Web Hosting Pad\'s terms of service indicate that its definition of unlimited is what it calls \"incremental.\" Basically, as you need more capability, it wants to discuss that with you, both to help you get the most out of its services, and to make sure you\'re using its systems without abusing them.\r\n\r\nThe company\'s entry-point pricing is extremely low -- we\'d say it\'s among the lowest-cost web hosting when you first start -- and while this will buy you up to three years of very cheap web hosting, do be aware that its post-promotion price will increase substantially, putting its subsequent year pricing more in line with the rest of its competitors. That said, we liked its 24/7 phone customer support, SSD support on some plans and 30-day money-back guarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\nHostPapa\r\nShared hosting starting at $3.95/mo. \r\nReseller hosting starting at $29.99/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $44.99/mo. \r\nEstablished back in 1998, HostPapa operates three state-of-the-art data centers. Equipped with multiple GigE fiber connections to the internet backbone, the company built out seismically braced racks and cabinets, fully redundant Liebert HVAC cooling systems, a diesel generator that can run for weeks and a preaction dry pipe fire suppression system.\r\n\r\nAll of this infrastructure has been built out to support the a wide range of hosting services. The family-owned company gains points for understanding the importance of transaction security by offering free AutoSSL and Let\'s Encrypt SSL encryption for its plans. While the company offers sophisticated services for technically strong clients, it also has a Weebly web builder option to get you up and running quickly. \r\n\r\nSome plans offer SSD performance, and while there\'s no uptime monitoring provided, the company also gained a nod for its offering of both Linux and Windows plans. \r\n\r\nFor the technically inclined, SSH access is available for a $2/mo upcharge, as is a dedicated IP address. The company allows for backup through its various dashboards and permits customers to build scripts to automate the backup process. While the company doesn\'t automatically perform malware scans, you can request one if desired. \r\n\r\n\r\nBigCommerce\r\nStandard plan starting at $29.95/mo. \r\nPlus plan starting at $79.95/mo. \r\nPro plan starting at $249.95/mo. \r\nBigCommerce is a bit different from our other hosting plans in that it\'s a SaaS (software-as-a-service) provider instead of an IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) provider. In other words, rather than renting space on a virtual machine where you setup and configure your own site, BigCommerce provides you with an app you login to that creates and online store. \r\n\r\nSo instead of worrying about servers and hosting applications, SSH and cPanel, you\'re going to be paying more attention to the business applications you can integrate with, the selling channels you use and the products and inventory you spotlight. \r\n\r\nThe key benefit is that, out of the box, you are able to host securely, drive traffic, convert visitors, accept payments, and ship and fulfill orders. There\'s even an API so that if you do scale and need special integrations unique to your business, you can make it happen. \r\n\r\nService price varies a lot. There are really two factors: how much you pay per transaction and the features offered. All plans charge $0.30 per transaction plus a percentage. \r\n\r\nAt the lowest end, you\'ll be paying 2.9% of the amount you charge. Bumping up to the Plus plan gets you a lowered 2.5% of the transaction fee and adds Google customer reviews, the ability for customers to filter their product searches and custom SSL (a security certificate you may have already purchased). \r\n\r\nThe Pro plan is costly, but you get a lot. First, you share considerably less of each transaction\'s cost, down to 2.2%. Then, on top of the Plus plan features, you get even more customized filtering, price lists, unlimited API calls, can have sales up to $400K per month, and get premium hosting account services. \r\n\r\nIf your hosting needs lean towards setting up an online store first and foremost, give BigCommerce a look. \r\n\r\n\r\n1&1 IONOS \r\nShared hosting starting at $4/mo.\r\nWordPress hosting starting at $1/mo.\r\nVPS hosting starting at $2/mo. \r\nDedicated server starting at $45/mo.\r\nCloud hosting starting at $15/mo. \r\n1&1 IONOS provides a wide range of hosting services, along with a full e-commerce stack, domain name registration, Office 365 solutions and online marketing programs. \r\n\r\nThe company also offers higher-end Windows and Linux servers, available with Plesk and cPanel respectively. We were very intrigued to see that the company offers low-end Atom-based dedicated servers as well as the more traditional Xeon-based machines. One great resource for those doing some basic experimentation, or site development, is that it has a free, three-month trial for one of its lightly equipped Atom servers.\r\n\r\nBe careful when placing an order with this company. Most of its plans jump in price after a year, but some (like dedicated servers) jump after six months, and the buck-a-month advertised basic web hosting plan jumps to $4 per month after just a month of service.\r\n\r\nGood phone, email and chat tech support, along with SSD-based hosting for faster performance and a free SSL certificate round out the offerings.\r\n\r\nSiteGround \r\nShared web hosting starting at $3.95/mo.\r\nWordPress hosting starting at $3.95/mo.\r\nReseller server starting at $42/year.\r\nCloud hosting starting at $80/mo.\r\nSiteGround sits in the middle ground between a consumer web hosting provider and those who cater to enterprise business solutions. If you\'ve got a small business with more complex web needs than a typical small business, SiteGround is an ideal solution.\r\n\r\nAlthough offerings start as low as $3.95 per month, we particularly like the company\'s GoGeek plan, which is chock full of useful features, including access to a staging server and one-click Git repo creation.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a lot to like about SiteGround, but the web host company did lose some points due to its policy of more than doubling your hosting costs after the first year. That nice $3.95/mo price shoots up to $11.95 per month. The company calls it a first-year discount, but that\'s in very tiny, light gray print.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, SiteGround offers free automatic daily backups, access to the Cloudflare CDN, high-performance SSDs for all plans, unlimited email accounts and integration of the free LetsEncrypt SSL certificate into sites. The company does limit bandwidth and storage, but even those who claim to offer so-called unlimited bandwidth and storage really have some limits in its terms of service.\r\n\r\nSiteGround is proactive about protecting its customers\' security. It has a dedicated security team that writes necessary patches and web firewall rules that help mitigate zero-day vulnerabilities. It also uses an AI-based system to monitor and apply fixes to all its servers dynamically.\r\n\r\nFinally, the company offers an entire tier of custom enterprise business services. So, if you start out with a small business and do GrowBig (as its mid-tier plan is named), you\'ll be able to stay with the company no matter how big you get.\r\n\r\nGreenGeeks \r\nShared hosting starting at $2.95/mo. \r\nWordPress hosting starting at $2.95/mo. \r\nReseller hosting starting at $19.95/mo. \r\nVPS hosting starting at $5/mo. \r\nDedicated servers starting at $169/mo. \r\nIf you\'ve ever been worried about the tremendous amount of power large data centers consume, you might want to sign up with Green Geeks. The \"green\" in the company\'s name reflects the Green Geeks\' commitment to the environment. It purchases three times the energy it actually uses in wind energy credits, essentially putting energy back into the economy. The company does this through a form of renewable energy certificates, which, while a bit complicated, means that it\'s not just energy neutral, i\'s actually helping fuel the green energy economy.\r\n\r\nJust because it\'s green doesn\'t mean it limits your power to do what you need with your websites. Rather surprisingly, its low-end account provides both SSH and WP-CLI (useful for WordPress websites and automated WordPress deployments) access, along with Git preinstalled. It\'s also possible to customize PHP and PHP.INI, a capability unheard of on a low-end plan.\r\n\r\nThe web host company offers an all-SSD infrastructure, 24/7 phone support, 30-day money-back guarantee, free site migration and malware detection. The only concern we had is that after your discounted purchase period expires, basic shared hosting jumps to $9.95 per month.\r\n\r\nGlowHost \r\nShared hosting starting at $4.95/mo.\r\nReseller hosting starting at $24.95/mo.\r\nElastic Sites hosting starting at $13.49/mo.\r\nSemi-dedicated servers starting at $49.99/mo.\r\nManaged dedicated servers starting at $129.95/mo.\r\nCloud VPS hosting starting at $75.00/mo.\r\nEnterprise cloud hosting starting at $199.00/mo.\r\nGlowHost offers a wide variety of plans for those with very different hosting needs. We were particularly impressed with its media hosting plans, which include offerings for FFmpeg, SHOUTcast and podcast hosting.\r\n\r\nThe company doesn\'t list a virtual private server offering, but it bills its Elastic Sites service as a VPS alternative, offering the ease of use of a simple shared hosting plan and the performance and scalability of a VPS. GlowHost also offers a number of different cloud hosting plans, with special attention to providing enterprise-grade services.\r\n\r\nGlowHost earned our kudos for its 91-day money-back guarantee. It\'s six days short of DreamHost\'s 97-day guarantee, but with these numbers, who\'s quibbling over a few days? The company also offers 24/7/365 phone support option and free cPanel offering for most plans. The company operates 18 data centers worldwide. Finally, the company garnered extra kudos by driving all its hosting services with wind power.\r\n\r\nPlanning your purchase\r\nWhen shopping for web hosting solutions, keep a few things in mind\r\n\r\nBig price jump after promo period\r\nMany web hosting services offer a low \"starting price,\" but require you to prepay for two or three years of service to get that price. After the promotional period, the renewal price for some web hosting services can be two, three, or even four times the initial promotional pricing. While the initial deal might be incredible, the cost of transferring your site (or paying the added fee) in a couple of years may be something to consider for even the cheapest web hosting service.\r\n\r\nWhat \"unlimited\" really means \r\nMany web hosting services offer so-called unlimited or unmetered service for whatever amount of bandwidth, disk storage and sites you use. It\'s important to understand that most terms of service actually do limit the definition of \"unlimited\" to what\'s considered reasonable use. The bottom line is simple: if you\'re building a pretty basic website, unlimited bandwidth means you don\'t need to worry. But if you\'re trying to do something excessive (or illegal, immoral or fattening), the fine print in the hosting platform\'s terms of service will trigger, and you\'ll either be asked to spend more or go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWatch out for page builders \r\nAlmost all the services offer some sort of drag-and-drop website builder that makes it easy to drag and drop items to build your page. These are great for getting started, but they often lock you into the service. Most website builder setups are proprietary to the service, or don\'t create HTML that\'s portable enough to be easily moved to another service if you decide it\'s necessary.\r\n\r\nMigration services are great, mostly \r\nMigration or transfer services are often free or offered at a reasonable fee at web hosting companies. These services help move your existing site to the new hosting provider. They can save a huge amount of hassle. Just remember that the migration process is often automated, and may fit in with the host\'s processes and needs rather than yours. Not everything may migrate, and you may find the organization of the newly migrated site makes for harder maintenance in the long run.\r\n\r\nKeep those concepts in mind as you shop for a hosting service. Our hosting service rankings are based on nearly 40 factors including quality of the support team, guarantee, availability of security services, performance architecture and promotional pricing. \r\n\r\nMore information about website hosting\r\nYou may also find other hosting services more appropriate depending on your needs. Hosting services such as cloud hosting, e-commerce hosting, reseller hosting and managed WordPress hosting are providing customers with a lot of flexibility.\r\n\r\nCloud-based hosting is a great option if you want to make sure you have a lot of storage space and allows you to utilize cloud computing to do so. There are many advantages to selecting cloud-based hosting, such as guaranteed server resources, redundant data storage and unlimited website growth.\r\n\r\nE-commerce hosting is a popular option for many online businesses. In addition to providing customers with functionality for an e-commerce site, many web-hosting service providers are also capable of providing you with a web server to host your website, along with an email server and other standard web-hosting features.\r\n\r\nReseller hosting is ideal for users who are interested in using his or her allotted hard drive space and bandwidth to host websites on behalf of third-parties. To do this, the reseller will need to purchase the host\'s services wholesale and then sell them to customers separately for a potential profit at retail prices.\r\n\r\nWordPress hosting is an ideal platform for customers who are interested in creating a custom-built website. WordPress is popular among customers because it lets you build a professional custom website using a variety of templates, plug-ins and widgets.\r\n\r\nWhat about after picking a provider?\r\nOnce you choose your provider, it\'s time for you to open an account with the monthly plan that fits your needs. If you still have questions about which plan is suitable for you, call its customer support staff and have them assist you through the registration process. Companies will generally charge a credit card on a monthly basis, however, some companies will also offer discounts for paying a yearly payment at once.\r\n\r\nAfter selecting a provider, it\'s highly recommended that you test your internet speed to ensure that the data is being processed in a timely manner. You can take the Internet Speed Test to instantly assess your load time and current upload and download internet speeds.\r\n\r\nHow to speed up your website? Finding the fastest hosting provider?\r\nPeople often think that a web host is the main cause of a slow website but, this is often not the case. When picking a provider, it\'s important for find a hosting provider that is close to your users and has a good amount of RAM and fast CPU power. Beyond that, it\'s often the way the website is set up that slows it down for users. To ensure that your website speed is optimal for users you need to make sure you pay attention to the following:\r\n\r\nMinimize HTTP requests to the server. This means that we limit the amount of request that are required to download the page\r\nEnable server caching. With server caching, after content has been download, the content is stored locally to allow faster access of the content and a reduction of strain on your web server.\r\nEnable compression of larger files. Compression reduces the bandwidth of your files, resulting in a lower HTTP response.\r\nRemove code bloat. Remove any unnecessary code or plugins.\r\nOptimize images. This will reduce overall page size.\r\nThere are many other ways to increase website speed but, these are the items that will have the biggest impact. \r\n', 'https://www.cnet.com/news/best-web-hosting-providers-for-2020-dreamhost-bluehost-a2hosting-more/', 0, 'Hosting.jpg');
